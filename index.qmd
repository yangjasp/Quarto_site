Hi! I'm Jasper, and I am an incoming Biostatistics PhD student at the University of Washington. I completed my undergraduate studies at Grinnell College where I majored in biology and concentrated (minored) statistics. I am currently finishing up my MSc in Statistics at the University of Essex and work as a research assistant in the [Shaw Lab](https://shawstat.org/) at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.

My primary research interests are in electronic health records (EHR), Bayesian inference, comparative effectiveness, and decision theory. I am also interested in rationality and the philosophy of science. I am passionate about problems that seek to find optimal decisions given data and uncertainty.

Recently, I have conducted research projects analyzing the determinants of COVID-19 hospital outcomes in the University of Pennsylvania Health System and developing software for efficient multi-wave sampling under two-phase designs. I have also been involved in the statistical analysis for multiple clinical trials. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing any sport from soccer to baseball, travelling, playing trivia, and biking. I am an avid Boston sports fan, and my love for statistics grew out of studying Major League Baseball statistics as a kid.

This website contains my personal blog, where I occasionally post about interesting applications of statistics in science, philosophy, sports, and more. It also contains links to some of my published and hopefully-soon-to-be-published work!
